#Herb Garden#

###My Sinatra Project###

This app allows a user to create a personal database of medicinal herbs. The user will begin by creating an account with their name, email, and a password. The user can then create herbs by using the create form to input the various properties of the herb. After the herb has been created it can then be viewed, updated and deleted as needed. This app also has a search page that allows the user to search using 1 of 5 different properties. The user may search by name, taste, energetics, actions and what the herb is ideal for addressing. The user can then logout and log back in to the app as they see fit.
